Completely restructured and enhanced the "极点 (Pole)" bookmark blog functionality.
Key Improvements:
- **Homepage (README.md)**: Redesigned with better structure, updated all extension icons to use correct paths from respective directories (mark/, chishu/, shadow/, sensory/, y2k/).
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Added hierarchical structure with "我的扩展" section listing all 5 extensions, plus "分类浏览" section.
- **Extension Detail Pages**: Created dedicated pages for each extension (qianmian-shuqian.md, chi-su.md, banying.md, sensory-flow.md, y2k-ifier.md) with consistent template including logo, description, features, links, and version info.
- **Category Pages**: Enhanced dev.md and tools.md with better organization, using correct image paths, and added helpful tips.
- **Image Paths**: Fixed all image references to use correct paths from individual extension directories.
- **Content Organization**: Improved categorization with more descriptive labels (生产力工具, 开发者工具, 影音工具, 交互增强, 风格工具).
