Added advanced interactive animations to the docsify homepage.
Key Technical Implementations:
- **3D Interactive Background**: Integrated `Vanta.js (Net mode)` with `Three.js`. This creates a dynamic 3D neural-link network that responds to mouse movements.
- **Entrance Animations**: Used `Animate.css` to add sequenced entrance effects (`fadeInDown`, `fadeInUp`, `zoomIn`) to the hero title, slogan, and buttons.
- **Glassmorphism Redux**: Set the cover section background to transparent to allow the 3D canvas to show through, maintaining the high-end aesthetic.
- **Responsive Colors**: Configured Vanta.js to use the project's theme color (`#42b983`).
