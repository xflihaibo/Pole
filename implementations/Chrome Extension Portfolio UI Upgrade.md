Upgraded the blog to a "Chrome Extension Portfolio" style.
Key UI Changes:
- **Card Layout**: Switched from vertical to horizontal layout to highlight App Icons (similar to Chrome Web Store).
- **Glassmorphism**: Added `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` and semi-transparent backgrounds for a premium look.
- **Badges**: Added version badges and category tags within the card metadata.
- **Typography**: Refined font weights and used ellipsis for long titles/descriptions to ensure grid consistency.
- **Animations**: Added a bouncy `cubic-bezier` scale effect on hover.

Content:
- Populated `README.md` with the user's recent extensions (千面书签, ChiSu, 伴影, SensoryFlow, Y2K-ifier).
