Upgraded the "极点 (Pole)" logo to a more sophisticated version.
Key Improvements:
- **Complex Geometry**: Moved from 4 simple birds to an 8-bird hierarchical structure (4 complex primary birds, 4 secondary subtle birds).
- **Gradients & Filters**: Added linear gradients (`#42b983` to `#23d5ab`) and an SVG `glow` filter for a premium, high-tech look.
- **Dynamic Energy Center**: Replaced the simple pulse with a dual-circle energy core with varying opacities.
- **Advanced Animations**:
    - Primary birds have custom translation paths.
    - Secondary birds have asynchronous opacity pulses.
    - Added a "star track" (rotating dashed circle) for extra depth.
- **Visual Scale**: Increased logo size from 120px to 180px for a more balanced hero presence.
