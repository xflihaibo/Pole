Designed and implemented a custom SVG logo for "极点 (Pole)".
Design Concept:
- **Central Point**: A pulsating green circle representing the "Pole" (resource convergence).
- **Gathering Birds**: Four minimalist bird icons (simplified wings) orbiting and facing the center.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: 
    - The center point pulses.
    - The birds have individual floating animations.
    - The entire bird cluster rotates slowly, creating a sense of orbital convergence.
- **Aesthetic**: Minimalist SVG integrated directly into `_coverpage.md` with drop shadows and CSS animations.
- **Removal**: Removed the rocket emoji as requested.
