Pivoted the "极点 (Pole)" logo from a bird theme to a "Nexus Core" (Digital Nexus) theme.
Design Concept:
- **Core Symbol**: A double-layered Hexagon representing stability and data structure.
- **Converging Beams**: Pulsing laser-like lines from North, South, East, and West directed at the core, emphasizing the "convergence" of resources.
- **Orbital Particles**: Two particles moving along elliptical paths (via `animateMotion`) to give a sense of dynamic data flow.
- **Color Palette**: Shifted to a High-Tech Cyan/Blue gradient (`#00f2fe` to `#4facfe`) for a more futuristic/cyberpunk feel.
- **Visual Effects**: 
    - Added a "Scanning Line" that rotates 360 degrees.
    - Used a `neonGlow` filter for a high-intensity energy look.
    - Applied the same gradient to the "极点 (Pole)" text for brand consistency.
