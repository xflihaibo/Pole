Restored the docsify UI configuration after it was accidentally overwritten by a `docsify init` command.
Started the docsify server in the background using `docsify serve docs`.
Confirmed that the custom bookmark card CSS, dark mode plugin, and other UI enhancements are active in `docs/index.html`.
